# Bootstrap Assignment

This project demonstrates the use of Bootstrap to create a responsive web page. Key features include:

- **Responsive Navigation Bar:** Collapses into a hamburger menu on small screens.
- **Registration Form:** Includes side-by-side First Name and Last Name fields, required Email and Password fields, and a terms checkbox.
- **Data Table:** Displays sample user data with striped and hoverable rows, wrapped for responsiveness.
- **Images and Buttons:** Features a responsive image, a circular image, and two buttons (one always visible, one hidden on small screens).

Built with Bootstrap 5.3.0 via CDN, ensuring full responsiveness across devices.
